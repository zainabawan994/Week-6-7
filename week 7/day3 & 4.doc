React Project Folder Structure

When you create a React project (for example, using Create React App or Vite), the default folder structure usually contains a public folder and a src folder. The public folder holds static files such as the HTML template and images that do not change during the build process. The main development work happens inside the src folder. In src, you generally keep the index.js or main.jsx file where the React app is rendered, and the App.js file which serves as the main component. A good practice for larger projects is to organize src into subfolders. For example, you might have a components folder for reusable UI pieces, a pages folder for full-page components, a hooks folder for custom hooks, an assets folder for images and styles, a context folder if you are using React Context for state management, and a services or api folder for functions that handle data fetching. This kind of structure keeps the project clean, modular, and easier to scale.

Custom Hooks (Basic Introduction)

Custom hooks in React are functions that allow you to reuse stateful logic across multiple components. They follow the same rules as built-in hooks (their name must start with use, and they can only be called inside React function components or other hooks). For example, if you have a component that fetches data with useEffect and useState, and you need the same data fetching logic in another component, you can move that logic into a custom hook and reuse it. This helps reduce repetition, keeps components cleaner, and makes your code more modular. Custom hooks do not add new features to React; instead, they are a way to share and organize logic. A simple example could be a custom hook that tracks the window size, or one that manages form input state.
